# Robot Localization and Landmark Detection Using Graph SLAM

![header](images/readme_slam.gif)

## Objective

In this project, I have implemented Graph SLAM in a 2D grid world where the robot tracks it's movements and detects the surrounding landmarks such as building, trees, rocks etc using its distance measurement sensors and motion poses.

## Results

Please head over to Notebook 3 of the project to see the final results and conclusion.
